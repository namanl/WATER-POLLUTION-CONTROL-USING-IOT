# WATER-POLLUTION-CONTROL-USING-IOT

This project mainly focuses on how different sensors connected to a server and database helps in identifying whether the water stored in different storage tanks like overhead tanks are suitable for human consumption. It uses a real time monitoring of water quality in Internet of things (IOT) using different sensor for the physical and chemical measure of water including turbidity, temperature, pH and flow sensor. The measured values from the sensors can be processed by the core controller. The Arduino model can be used as a core controller. The traditional methods of water quality monitor involve the manual collection of water samples from different locations. The project has basically set different standards for different values of sensor so over a period of average values of these sensors will decide whether the water is polluted or not and inform the user you change the water from the stored tank and if required clean the storage tank/area. Finally, the output will be displayed through various colored led which determine the quality of water
